## **Map Customization**

---
As the BlueMap is a departure from the standard [Dynmap](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dynmap%C2%AE.274/), especially with the additions we've made; 

We have compiled a guide for people wanting to tune their Live Map for Looks or Performance.

# **Performance**

---
As with the map being more graphically intense, some devices may suffer through the website giving a terrible experience for the Player, so BlueMap offers settings to give players the ability to enable and disable certain aspects.

All of these being located under the "Markers" tab in Bluemap.
