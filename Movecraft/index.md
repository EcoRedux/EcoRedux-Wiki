**Movecraft** is a server plugin that gives players the ability to create their own custom vehicles, those ranging from ships, to planes, etc.

**Movecraft** categorizes these vehicles into custom [Craft Types](https://wiki.ecoredux.net/Movecraft/CraftTypes.html) , each with their own unique specifications and abilities. These abilities ranging from speed, to descending to greater depths, and specifications in size.

Each player's created craft must fit the specifications of the Craft Type it is in. 

You must also ensure that your craft is only made up of the allotted [Allowed Blocks](https://wiki.ecoredux.net/Movecraft/Tutorial.html) available.

# **Movecraft: A Tutorial:**

**How do I Create my Craft?**

 - To Create a Ship, you must build, a craft that complies to the given specifications of a craft.

 - You must also ensure that all blocks apart of your craft, are not connected to land, or connected diagonally.
   
     - (These will break the mobility function of your craft, or simply not be counted as part of your craft.)

        - Place a sign with the name of the craft class you are using.
