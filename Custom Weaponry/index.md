We utilize the [Quality Armory](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/bukkit-plugins/qualityarmory) Plugin for our guns. More information (if neccescary) can be viewed on their linked plugin page.

Guns are available to be crafted ingame out of a variety of materials. These guns must be supplied by their respective ammo.
