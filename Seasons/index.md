# RealisticSeasons
EcoRedux uses the [RealisticSeasons](https://wiki.realisticseasons.com/) plugin to add more challenges to the server.

Players will have to learn to adapt and play around with temperatures, seasons, and climates.\
RealisticSeasons can either greatly help or greatly hinder players, depending on if they can use the features to their advantage.
