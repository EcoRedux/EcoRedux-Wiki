# ImageFrame

ImageFrame is a plugin that allows players to turn empty maps into images or GIFs.

---

## Creating Images

### Obtaining maps
You must have the correct amount of empty maps in your inventory for the plugin to work.\
The required amount is the area of your image (width * height).

### Creating the image
First of all, get a direct link to the image. If you are on discord, a simple way is to upload your image to a private channel/DM, then right click it and copy link on PC, or click the image and the 3 dots and then copy link on mobile.

> Note: Ensure that the link is a direct link to the image and not a discord channel link!

Next, you will have two options for the image. You can either create the image as separate maps or as a combined map. Seperate maps must be individually placed in their item frames, while combined maps just need a click in one item frame for it to display the whole image.

To create an image as separate maps, do `/imageframe create (name) (url) (width) (height)`
To create an image as a combined map, do `/imageframe create (name) (url) (width) (height) combined`

### Cloning images
You can clone images by their name with `/imageframe get (name)` or `/imageframe get (name) combined`

### Converting .MP4 files into .GIF files
if you are trying to add a GIF from discord into the game, you may receive an error due to discord sometimes using the .mp4 file format.

There are two ways to convert file formats. First, you can use software. Secondly, you can use an online tool, but beware that quality drops may occur.
