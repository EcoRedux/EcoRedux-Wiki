# Towny Cultures

> Towny Cultures allows you to assign your town a specific culture.

> These can be viewed under a town, or nations info. `/t` or `/n`

Residents of each culture are able to communicate with others of the same culture.

This can be done by performing the command, `/cc [message]`

You must be a mayor to assign your towns culture, however, no culture has any set leader. Set cultures by performing the command, `/t set culture [culture]`

A Nations culture consists of a culmination of it's towns cultures.

### Uses within cultures

Cultures can be important, because after a town has been transferred to another nation, via war, or secession, they are still capable of messaging old members within the same culture.
