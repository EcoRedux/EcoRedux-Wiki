### We at [Ecoredux](https://discord.com/invite/ecoredux) utilize Towny as our form of creating Towns, Nations, and so on.

##Introduction

---

Towny is a town and nation system that allows you to:

- Create Towns & Nations

- Manage those Towns & Nations

- And form alliances and enemies with other groups of players

> If you are already familiar with towny, you can visit our full list of [Commands](https://wiki.ecoredux.net/Towny/Commands.html) or our [Starter Guide](https://wiki.ecoredux.net/Towny/Starter%20Guide.html).

Towny seperates the map's land into 16x16 plots. These plots are in-line with Minecraft's pre-existing set of Chunks. *Pressing F3+G can allow you to view these chunks ingame.*

By default, these chunks are wilderness, which means anybody can lay claim to them. However, you, and other players have the ability to take these chunks as your own. 

To claim these chunks, stand in your desired position, and perform the command: `/t new [Town Name]`. 

These towns are comprised of "Residents". Every player that joins your town is considered a resident of it. You can look up their info by performing the command: `/resident [Player]`

Each town is comprised of residents, however, these residents are capable of having seperate [Ranks](https://wiki.ecoredux.net/Towny/Ranks.html) that grant them different permissions. 

The player who has created the town, *"The Mayor*, is the only player who has the ability to grant other residents their ranks.

Your town also is comprised of a Town Bank. This bank is what is used for when you, claim land, or deposit money into it. The Bank also provides money for your town's upkeep.

Your upkeep is determined by the amount of land you have claimed, and can be viewed by performing the command: `/t`
