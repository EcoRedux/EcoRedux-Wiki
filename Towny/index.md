### We at [Ecoredux](https://discord.com/invite/ecoredux) utilize Towny as our form of creating Towns, Nations, and so on.

## Introduction

---

Towny is a town and nation system that allows you to:

- Create Towns & Nations

- Manage those Towns & Nations

- And form alliances and enemies with other groups of players

> If you are already familiar with towny, you can visit our full list of [Commands](https://wiki.ecoredux.net/Towny/Commands.html) or our [Starter Guide](https://wiki.ecoredux.net/Towny/Starter%20Guide.html).

Towny seperates the map's land into 16x16 plots. These plots are in-line with Minecraft's pre-existing set of Chunks. *Pressing F3+G can allow you to view these chunks ingame.*

By default, these chunks are wilderness, which means anybody can lay claim to them. However, you, and other players have the ability to take these chunks as your own. 

To claim these chunks, stand in your desired position, and perform the command: `/t new [Town Name]`. 

These towns are comprised of "Residents". Every player that joins your town is considered a resident of it. You can look up their info by performing the command: `/resident [Player]`

Each town is comprised of residents, however, these residents are capable of having seperate [Ranks](https://wiki.ecoredux.net/Towny/Ranks.html) that grant them different permissions. 

The player who has created the town, *"The Mayor"*, is the only player who has the ability to grant other residents their ranks.

Your town also is comprised of a Town Bank. This bank is what is used for when you, claim land, or deposit money into it. The Bank also provides money for your town's upkeep.

Your upkeep is determined by the amount of land you have claimed, and can be viewed by performing the command: `/t` 

---

## Further Introduction

---

The name of your Town can be altered at any time. To do this, perform the command: `/t set name [Name]`

By default, anybody that is not in your town, does not have access to build, destroy, or alter any items within your claims.

Any resident within a town, besides the mayor, can leave at any time. This can be done by performing the command: `/t leave` 

Please Note that in order to be allowed back in, you must be invited by either the mayor, or anybody with applicable permissions.

### Claiming

---

Claiming is performed by doing `/t claim` in a respective chunk. Your land can be viewed on our [Live Map](https://map.ecoredux.net) .

You can also change your town's color of claims, and if in a nation, the border color as well.

You can do this by performing the commands: `/t set mapcolor [color]` *or* `/n set mapborder [color]`.

To remove your claim from the map, you can perform: `/t unclaim`. However, you will not be refunded the costs to claim that land originally.

There are other types of land that can be claimed, for example, an outpost.

To claim an outpost, perform the command, `/t claim outpost`. To teleport there, it will have a respective number. For example, `/t outpost 1`.

---

## Town Spawn

---

Your town spawn is dictated by it's **Homeblock** and **Spawnpoint**.

To set your homeblock, go to your desired location, and perform the command, `/t set homeblock`. 

Then, anywhere within that chunk, you can perform the command, `/t set spawnpoint`.

---

## Nations

---

If your town is invited to a Nation, you can perform the command, `/accept [Name of Nation]`.

While within this nation, you will recieve an extra amount of townblocks available to you. 

However you may also have to pay a daily **Nation Tax**.
